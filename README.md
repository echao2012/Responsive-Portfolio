# Responsive-Portfolio
**Visit the deployed site here: https://echao2012.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/**

This example portfolio website implements media queries for a responsive layout.

In style.css, there are three @media screen tags for each of these max-width sizes: 980px, 768px, and 640px.

Use the Mobile Device simulator in Chrome DevTools to see how the website responds to different screen sizes.
