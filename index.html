        <!-- Paragraph text about me -->
        <p>My name is Eric Chao, and I live in Austin, Texas. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.</p>
        <p>I specialize in embedded systems, and have worked for semiconductor and defense companies. I am currently studying web development, as I am passionate about learning the latest technologies.</p>
        <p>I love playing with new gadgets and electronics. Most of my time is probably spent playing Nintendo and computer games. Otherwise, if the weather is nice, I enjoy going for a hike. I also collect Star Wars Lego sets and have over 20,000 Lego pieces in my home!</p>
